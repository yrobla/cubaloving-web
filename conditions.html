SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF CERTAIN DAMAGES, SO SOME OR ALL OF THE EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

			</p>
			<br>
			
			<h2>15.	Retroactive and potential arbitration, class action waiver, and jury trial waiver.</h2>
			<p>Except where prohibited by applicable law:
			<ol>
<li>The exclusive means for the resolution of any controversy or claim arising out of or related to this Agreement (including any alleged violation thereof) or the Service, regardless of the date of emergence and including all past, pending and future claims, will be the BINDING ARBITRATION. Such arbitration shall be conducted with written submissions only, unless you and Cubaloving decide to invoke the right to an oral hearing before an arbitrator. But if you choose arbitration or small claims court, you agree that under no circumstances will you initiate, maintain or participate in any class action, class arbitration or other representative action or proceeding against Cubaloving.</li>
<li>By accepting this Agreement, you agree to the Arbitration Agreement in this Section 16 (subject to the limited one-time opt-out right for existing users within thirty (30) days, discussed below). By doing so, YOU AND CUBALOVING WAIVE THE RIGHT TO GO TO TRIAL to assert or defend any claim between you and Cubaloving (except for matters that may be duly brought to a small claims court and are within the jurisdiction of said court). YOU ALSO WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR OTHER CLASS PROCEEDING E </li>
<li>If you bring a claim against Cubaloving outside of small claims court, your rights will be determined by a NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR, NOT A JUDGE OR JURY, and the arbitrator will determine all claims and all issues relating to the arbitrability of the dispute. The same is true for Cubaloving. Both you and Cubaloving have the right to a fair hearing before the arbitrator. The arbitrator can generally grant the same solution as a court, but you should keep in mind that arbitration procedures are generally simpler and more agile than trials and other court procedures. The arbitrator's decisions are enforceable in court and can be reversed by a court for only very limited reasons. </li>
<li>The provisions of jurisdiction and the meeting place in sections 1 6 to 1 7 are incorporated and are applicable to this Arbitration Agreement. </li>
</ol>

In deciding whether to accept this Arbitration Agreement, here are some important considerations:
 <ul>
<li>Arbitration is a private dispute resolution process that does not involve civil proceedings, a civil judge, or a jury. Arbitration does not limit or affect the legal claims that you as an individual can bring against Cubaloving. Acceptance of arbitration will only affect where such claims can be brought and how they will be resolved.</li>
 <li>Arbitration is generally viewed as a faster dispute resolution process than the court system, but that is not always the case. The Arbitrator will normally determine whether you or Cubaloving will have to pay or divide the cost of any arbitration with Cubaloving, based on the circumstances that arise.</li>
 <li>IMPORTANT: THERE ARE NOW, AND MAY BE IN THE FUTURE, LEGAL LAWSUITS AGAINST CUBALOVING THAT ALLEGE CLASS AND / OR REPRESENTATIVE CLAIMS ON YOUR BEHALF, INCLUDING BUT WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE CLASS ACTIONS DESCRIBED IN THIS SECTION 16, WHICH, IF SUCCESSFUL, MAY POTENTIALLY RESULT IN CERTAIN MONETARY OR OTHER RECOVERY FOR YOU, IF YOU CHOOSE THE VOLUNTARY EXCLUSION OF RETROACTIVE APPLICATION FROM THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT. THE MEAN EXISTENCE OF SUCH CLASS AND / OR REPRESENTATIVE JUDGMENTS, HOWEVER, DOES NOT MEAN THAT SUCH JUDGMENTS WILL FINALLY BE SUCCESSFUL OR THAT, EVEN IF SUCCESSFUL, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO ANY RECOVERY. </li>
 <li>You will be unable to bring any class or representative action against Cubaloving, unless you timely unsubscribe from the retroactive application of this Arbitration Agreement, and you will also be unable to participate in any recovery resulting from any class action or representative action. against Cubaloving, in each case, as long as you are not already subject to an arbitration agreement and the waiver of the class action previously agreed with Cubaloving.</li>
</ul>
ACCEPTING THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT IS AN IMPORTANT DECISION. THE DECISION SHOULD BE MADE BY YOU AND YOU SHOULD TAKE CARE OF MAKING FURTHER INVESTIGATION AND CONSULTING WITH OTHER PEOPLE - INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, AN ATTORNEY - AS TO THE CONSEQUENCES OF YOUR DECISION, AS YOU WOULD DO WHEN MAKING ANY OTHER COMMERCIAL DECISION.

			</p>
			<br>
			
			<h2>16.	Applicable legislation.</h2>
			<p>Except where our arbitration agreement is prohibited by law, the arbitration laws of the nations or states that include it in its legality will apply. Otherwise, the existing regulations for conflict resolution apply.
			</p>
			<br>
			
			<h2>17.	Instead of meeting.</h2>
			<p>Except for claims that may be properly presented in a small claims court of competent jurisdiction, all claims arising out of or related to this Agreement, the Service, or your relationship with Cubaloving that for any reason are not submitted to arbitration it shall be litigated exclusively in the courts of the legal address of the company, may waive r any claim that such courts constitute an inconvenient forum.
			</p>
			<br>
			
			<h2>18.	Indemnification on your part.</h2>
			<p>You agree, to the extent permitted by applicable law, to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Cubaloving, our affiliates, and there and our respective officers, directors, agents, and employees of and against any and all claims, demands, claims, damages, losses, costs, liabilities and expenses, including attorneys' fees, due to, arising out of, or related in any way to, your access to or use of the Service, your Content, or your breach of this Agreement.
